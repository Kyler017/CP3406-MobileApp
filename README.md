üëã Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for [Your App Name]!

This is my mobile application development project for the CP3406 / CP5307 subject. The goal was to build a fully functional Android app using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.



The app, [Your App Name], is designed to [Insert a brief, engaging 1-2 sentence description of what your app does and its target audience].

‚ú® Core Features
Here are the main features and functionality implemented in this application:

[Feature 1: e.g., Daily Task Tracker]: Users can [explain what the user can do].


[Feature 2: e.g., Weather API Integration]: The app uses an external API to fetch [data type] for [purpose].


[Feature 3: e.g., Persistent Data]: All user-created data, such as [data example], is stored locally and persistently.


[Feature 4: e.g., Detailed View]: A comprehensive view with navigation support to check all the specific details of a [data object].

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details
This project demonstrates several modern Android development best practices.


1. Architecture and Design
   I aimed for a clean and scalable application structure by using the following:


Jetpack Compose: Used exclusively for creating the entire UI, ensuring it is clean, responsive, and follows Material Design principles.


Modern App Architecture: I implemented the Repository Pattern and used ViewModels to separate the UI from business logic and manage data according to the Android lifecycle.


Dependency Injection (DI): [Mention which DI library you plan to use, e.g., Hilt/Koin] was used to manage dependencies efficiently, which makes the code more modular and testable.

2. Advanced APIs
   The app relies on two key advanced APIs to support its functionality:

Room Database: Implemented for local data persistence. This ensures that key data is saved locally so the app can function [mention if it supports offline access].

Network Connectivity: [Mention the networking library, e.g., Retrofit] is used to fetch data from the [External API Name, e.g., OpenWeatherMap API]. This provides novel and creative features such as.

3. Testing
   To ensure the app's stability, various testing methods were employed:

Unit Tests: Written to cover the core business logic in the ViewModels and Repository classes.

[Integration Tests / UI Tests]: [Choose one or both, and briefly explain what you tested, e.g., "UI Tests were written to ensure smooth navigation between key screens."]

üöÄ Getting Started
